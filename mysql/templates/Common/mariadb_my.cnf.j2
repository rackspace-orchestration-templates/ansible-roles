## This prevents using host-based authentication. That means users must be
## created using an ip-address (ie 'myuser'@'192.168.100.1') or must make
## use of the % wildcard (ie 'myuser'@'%'). The benefit to not using
## host-based authentication is that DNS will not impact MySQL performance.
skip-name-resolve

## If open-files-limit is set very low, MySQL may increase on its own. Either
## way, increase this if MySQL gives 'too many open files' errors. Setting
## this above 65535 could be unwise (MySQL may crash).
open-files-limit = 20000

### Cache
thread-cache-size = 16
table-open-cache = {{ mysql_table_open_cache }}
table-definition-cache = 512

## Generally, it is unwise to set the query cache to be larger than 64-128M
## as the costs associated with maintaining the cache outweigh the performance
## gains. A far superior solution would be to implement memcached, though this
## required modifying the application, among other things.

#### Storage Engines
## Set this to force MySQL to use a particular engine / table-type
## for new tables. This setting can still be overridden by specifying
## the engine explicitly in the CREATE TABLE statement.
default-storage-engine = InnoDB

## Makes sure MySQL does not start if InnoDB fails to start. This helps
## prevent ugly silent failures.
innodb = FORCE

### MyISAM
## Not sure what to set this to?
## Try running a 'du -sch /var/lib/mysql/*/*.MYI'
## This will give you a good estimate on the size of all the MyISAM indexes.
## (The buffer may not need to set that high, however)
{% if ansible_hostname|search('(^|-)db(-|[\d]{1,2})?') %}
key-buffer-size = {{ (ansible_memtotal_mb * 0.25)|int }}M
{% else %}
key-buffer-size = {{ mysql_key_buffer_size }}
{% endif %}

## This setting controls the size of the buffer that is allocated when
## sorting MyISAM indexes during a REPAIR TABLE or when creating indexes
## with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE.
myisam-sort-buffer-size = 128M

### InnoDB
## Note: While most settings in MySQL can be set at run-time, many InnoDB
## variables cannot be set at runtime as require restarting MySQL
###
## These settings control how much RAM InnoDB will use. Generally, when using
## mostly InnoDB tables, the innodb-buffer-pool-size should be as large as
## is possible without swapping or starving other processes of RAM. The other
## two settings usually do not need to be changed, but can help for very large
## datasets.
{% if ansible_hostname|search('(^|-)db(-|[\d]{1,2})?') %}
innodb-buffer-pool-size = {{ (ansible_memtotal_mb * 0.6)|int }}M
{% else %}

innodb-log-buffer-size = 8M
{% else %}
innodb-log-buffer-size = {{ mysql_innodb_log_buffer_size }}
{% endif %}

## Be careful when changing these as they require re-generating the
## ib-logfile* files, which must be done carefully. Do not change this unless
## you are familiar with the procedure.
innodb-log-file-size = 128M
innodb-log-files-in-group = 2

## This will cause each table to create its own .ibd file
innodb-file-per-table = 1

## Setting this to 2 will decrease disk I/O but can cause up to a second of
## queries to be lost during a hard outage (i.e. power failures)
# innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit = 2

### Replication
## Set this to the Server's instance ID in replication environments
server-id = {{ mysql_node_id }}

#log-bin = {{ mysql_log_bin }}
#relay-log = {{ mysql_log_relay }}
#relay-log-space-limit = 4G
#expire-logs-days = 5

## This should be enabled on conventional MySQL slaves
#read-only = 1

## This will cause replicated statements on a slave to be written to the slave's binlog
## Enable this on the middle slave of M->S->S configs
#log-slave-updates = 1

#binlog-format = STATEMENT

### Logging
## This option determines the destination for general query log and slow query log output.
## The option value can be given as one or more of the words TABLE, FILE, or NONE.
## NOTE: Table logging takes away 50% of performance and thus is not recommended
## http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=30414
## In addition, you cannot backup the contents of these tables properly
## (mysqldump skips these tables by default since they cannot be locked)
#log-output = FILE
slow-query-log = 1
slow-query-log-file = {{ mysql_log_slow }}
long-query-time = 2
#log-queries-not-using-indexes = 0

[mysqld-safe]

# * IMPORTANT: Additional settings that can override those from this file!
# The files must end with '.cnf', otherwise they'll be ignored.
